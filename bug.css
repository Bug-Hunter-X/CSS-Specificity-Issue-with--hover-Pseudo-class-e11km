The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the expected behavior of `:hover` pseudo-class is not met due to improper specificity or unexpected inheritance:

```css
.container {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.container:hover {
  background-color: lightgreen;
}

.container a {
  display: block;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: yellow;
}

.container a:hover {
  background-color: orange;
}
```

When hovering over the `<a>` element, the expected outcome is that only the `<a>` element's background color changes to orange. However, the `:hover` on `.container` also activates, causing a conflict and changing the background color of the `.container` to lightgreen.
This arises from specificity conflicts. The `:hover` on the anchor has lower specificity than the `.container:hover`, resulting in the latter taking precedence, unintentionally overriding the intended style.
